A project inspired by the need to replicate some of the capabilities of Modelica.Media within Matlab.

The tools currently provide two key features:

  * computation of thermodynamic properties (enthalpy, entropy, chemical potential, cp etc) of mixtures of chemical species as a function of temperature.

  * computation equilibrium compositions based on a given chemical reaction system

Test cases include:

  * Steam Methane Reforming
  * Haber process
  * Boudouard carbon formation
  * Computation of standard electrode potential for a H2 fuel cell
  * Steam/water two-phase model
  * Methane combustion
