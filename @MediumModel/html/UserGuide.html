%% Introduction to the use of MediumModel class on Matlab
% The MediumModel class is used for finding the equilibrium state of a 
% mixture of reacting ideal gases over a range of temperatures, pressures and
% compositions. It can calculate various properties of individual gases and gas mixtures 
% such and entropy and enthalpy.
% It can also plot the post reaction equilibrium composition of a mixture against
% temperature and includes methods to calculate and plot the Gibbs free energy of the system.
%
% The model uses data
% compiled by NASA in the paper:                                    
% NASA Glenn Coefficients for Calculating
% Thermodynamic Properties of Individual Species.

%% Example 1 - Instantiating a MediumModel Object

Example1 = MediumModel({'H2O'})
%%
% In this example, the model has only a single species. Later examples include more
% complex systems.
%
%% Class Properties
%
% Defined by the user:  _(Using standard SI units)_
%%
% * *T* - Temperature Range (Kelvin) _Default - 801 values, ranging from 273.15K to 1073.15K_
% * *Z* - Initial molar fractions of each species   _Default-equal molar proportions_
% * *X* - Initial mass fractions of each species. _This is calculated if Z is
% specified and vice versa_
% * *nu* - Stochiometry of defined chemical equations. _Empty by default_
% * *P0* -Atmospheric Pressure (Pascals) _Default - 100,000Pa_
% * *P*  -Pressure of reaction (Pascals) _Default - 100,000Pa_
% 
%
% Calculated based on user inputs: (All of these are matrices of values
% over the temperature range)
%
% The model uses the strMaster database, stored in the IdealGases file to find the relevant
% values using polynomial approximations, as found by NASA, over the required temperature range. 
%%
% * *cp / cp_V* - Specific heat capacity (J/mol K)
% * *h / h_V* - Specific enthalpy (J/mol)
% * *s / s_V* - Specific entropy (J/mol.K)
% * *mu / mu_V* - Chemical potential (J/mol)
% * *mm / mm_V* - Molar mass (g/mol)
% * *Zeq* - Molar fractions of each species at equilibrium over the
% temperature range
%
% The '_V' element of the parameters such as cp_V indicates that it is a vector.
% It differs from cp by that cp is the specific heat capacity of the
% mixture as a whole, while cp_V is a matrix showing the specific heat
% capacity of each individual species.
% Zeq is calculated after calling the SolveEq method, the others are properties
% obtained from the IdealGases database polynomial approximations.
% 
%% Class Methods
% Methods are used in the class to set values of properties, perform calculations and plot graphs:
%
% *Value setting methods*
%
% * *setT*     _-sets the object temperature range_
% * *setP*     _-sets the reaction and atmospheric pressures_
% * *setNu*    _-sets the object's chemical reation stochiometry_
% * *setZ*     _-sets the object's composition by moles_
% * *setX*     _-sets the object's composition by mass_
%
% *Calculation methods*
%
% * *gibbs* _- uses the Gibbs equation, g=h-Ts to calculate the enthalpy change of reaction
% for the specified stochiometry so the lowest free energy state can be
% calculated._
% * *solveEq* _- solves the relevant Gibbs equations to find the lowest
% free energy state and hence
% equilibrium proportions over the temperature range so the end results can be plotted._ 
% * *props* _- used to access the IdealGases database
% and uses the polynomial approximations to find the values of cp, h and s
% for the gases._
% * *moleToMassFractions* _- calculates relevant value by mass, if the user
% specifies values by moles_
% * *massToMoleFractions*  _- calculates relevant value by moles, if the user
% specifies values by mass_
% * *findTFromH* _- calculates temperatures when enthalpies are specified_
%
%
% |gibbs| and |solveEq| are executed in Example2 and Example3 below. The remaining
% calculation methods are internal methods that aren't directly called by the user. 
% |moleToMassFractions, massToMoleFractions| and
% |findTFromH| convert from one property to another as described, depending
% on which properties were initially defined by the user.
%
%
% *Graph plotting Methods*
%
% * plot
% * gibbsplot
%
% |plot| plots 4 graphs in one window, plotting each gas's cp, h, s and
% composition against temperature over the temperature range. |gibbsplot|
% produces two graphs, plotting free energy and equilibrium constant
% against temperature. |gibbsplot| is used in example2. |plot| is used in
% example3.
%
%

%%  Example 2 - Modelling a Simple Reaction System
% This example is a model of the Haber process reaction, used for making
% ammonia. The model will be used to find the resulting proportions of each gas at 
% equilibrium during the reaction process over the temperature range -50-
% to 500°C.
%

Example2 = MediumModel({'N2', 'H2', 'NH3'});
%%
% This creates an object with the specified species included in the model,
% and must include all products and reactants.
%
% *Specify reaction conditions*
% 
% The class requires 4 parameters to calculate how any reaction is
% expected to progress: Initial composition, stochiometry, temperature and pressure.
%
% *setZ* (Composition)
%
% The initial proportions of the species can be set by mass or molar relations.
% This example uses molar fractions. (Z)

Example2.setZ ([0.25, 0.75, 0]);

%%
% The proportions are defined in the same order as they are given in the class
% definition, as stored by the 'names' property and must sum to 1.00. (This example has 25% Nitrogen, 75% Hydrogen, 0% Ammonia)
%
% *setNu* (Stochiometry)
%
% The stochiometry of the chemical reactions must be specified in the model.
% In the example of the Haber process, the relevant reaction is: 
%
% $$N_2 + 3H_2 \leftrightarrow 2NH_3$$
Example2.setNu ([-1 -3 2]');
%%
% Reactants are given negative numbers, as they are used up, and products
% are given a positive number. This is also done using the same order as they were
% defined in the class. Note transpose operator, as each reaction is defined
% in its own column rather than row.
% Models with multiple reactions taking place can also be modeled using a
% nu matrix with additional columns, defining additional reactions. (See
% example 3)
%
% *setT* (Temperature)
%
% The model is often used to find the composition change over a range of
% temperatures, so the temperature is set as a range of values. 

Example2.setT((-50:10:500)+273.15) ;

%%
% Here, the range is set from -50 to 500°C , in steps of 10°C.
%
% *setP* (Pressure)
%
% The reaction and atmospheric pressures are set as a default of 100,000Pa,
% but can be modified by changing the properties P and P0 of the object.
% Here, the reaction pressure is changed to 500,000Pa and the pressure of the environment
% is modified to a more accurate value of 101,325Pa. |setP| can be used in
% the form setP(P) to just change reaction pressure, or setP(P,P0) to change
% both values.
Example2.setP(500000,101325)
%%
% *Solve calculations*
% 
% |The following two commands complete the calculations to model the
% system, ready for data plotting.
Example2.gibbs;
Example2.solveEq;

%% Output data and plotting
%
% The Matrix *Example2.Zeq* holds the molar compositions of each species in

% taking place side by side.

Example3.setZ(Z);
%%
% The object is defined with all required species, and the initial molar
% compositions are set by initially defining the proportions of each
% species, then dividing through by the sum to normalise the vector to sum to one as
% required.

Example3.setT([300:10:750]+273.15);

Example3.setNu(nu);
%%
% The nu matrix now has 2 columns, each with 6 rows, to represent the two
% reactions taking place. Remembering products +ve, reactants -ve
%%
% The method |plot|, used in Example 3, creates plots of cp, s, h and
% compostion against temperature, in one window
%%
% The Gibbs free energy and equilibrium composition are both calculated,
% then a plot made which is shown below.
